# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (This is a website designed using specs provided from another site. The page allows a user to be given random meal elements from a list of available options. This would cut down on any decision paralysis of the user.)

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (This site can be cloned by copying the SSH code from the GitHub page and using "git clone [SSH]" in your terminal.)

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Screenshot found in assets under "Screenshot".)

### Context:
[//]: <> (This was my first solo project. It was built to match a given website design and was completed in about 5 days.) 

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (This was a solo project built on my own. Github: https://github.com/jeremypearson08.)

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (The goal of this project was to familiar myself with CSS, HTML, Javascript, and the process of bringing them together into one site.)

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (Some challenges that I encountered were using CSS to place the boxes, without using flexbox and the folmulas in Javascript were also a challenge to work out.)
